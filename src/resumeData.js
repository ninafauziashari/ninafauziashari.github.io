Node.js and Express.js were used as the server and Postman was used for API testing. One of the benefits of Neo4j graph database is that it also acts as a Recommendation Engine. I thought it would be interesting to display the outcome through React Native. It is even more interesting that such combination has never been done before (at least no study, article or research paper was found regarding this)",
