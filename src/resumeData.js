I thought it would be interesting to display the outcome through React Native. It is even more interesting that such combination has never been done before (at least no study, article or research paper was found regarding this)",

The app helps the room attendants to change the status of room from uncleaned to cleaned, report maintenance issue and report guest’s left items. After all the rooms are completed, they will then send their reports to the head of room attendant. It is a very simple app as it was the first time ever was exposed to React Native",
